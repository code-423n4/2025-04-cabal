Hey all, excited for this audit to start tomorrow!

Please DM/tag me or @0xRadian anytime for any questions. We'll be providing

- Heavily commented code

- Test suite of over 120 tests, all passing, testing pretty much everything across the protocol

- Thorough documentation explaining the protocol, each module, and illustrated flowcharts of each major flow (function calls, etc.)

For people wondering how to run the project:

Make sure you have go lang installed. For macOS you can use `brew install go`
Clone https://github.com/initia-labs/initia/tree/v1.0.0-beta.8

Open Terminal, cd in `initia` root folder.
`make install`

Type `initiad version`, you should see the following output:
```bash
v1.0.0-beta.8
```

If you are experiencing issues, check the docs - https://initia.gitbook.io/initia/kBNuZF5MglV9d3zOOUeW/node-operators/running-initia-node/prerequisites#initia

Go to cabal's root folder and run `yarn install`
To run the tests: `yarn run test`
For specific test: `yarn run test- [name]`

Hello does anybody have issue with Move extensions ? I have installed them but when I click "go to definition" it just doesnt find definitions of the functions. I'm using ubuntu 20.04 on WSL


[04/30/2025 15:18] _givn
Same here. It appears that the VSCode extensions are made to look at specific path for the sui-framework / move-stdlib. Since we're using Initia they should be configured to look elsewhere but I'm not sure if this can happen.

For the time being I'm just referencing apis from the [initia_stdlib repo](https://github.com/initia-labs/movevm/tree/bf81d0d40e1514d308b3f5063ad37efa18bfac4d/precompile/modules/initia_stdlib/doc)

Can someone please point me to the `staking_addr` source code


[05/02/2025 17:21] _givn
`staking_addr` is declared in `Move.toml` and contains the modules (.move files) you see in scope.

`use staking_addr::bribe;` is actually `use <address>::<module name>;` 
it means "the bribe module published at the address named 'staking_addr'"

Hey guys, hope the hunting is going well.

Just wanted to let all of you know, that if you create private threads to please inculde both me @0xRadian  as well as @0xSigmoid . This decreases response time, which especially now with not so much time left, might be critical. It also allows us to coordinate better

[05/03/2025 20:04] theschnilch
i tried it but this just seems to be for a node that connects to the public network. I also looked through the app.toml config but I could find any parameter that would allow to run a private testnet.


[05/03/2025 20:05] theschnilch
@0xRadian @0xSigmoid Is there any way to run a local testnet or at least test the contracts without all the mocks?


[05/03/2025 20:09] 0xradian
I dont think that a local testnet would work


[05/03/2025 20:09] 0xradian
there is some parts of the code that are hard to test locally, such as the cosmos/ stargate calls


[05/03/2025 20:16] 0xradian
you could deploy on the actual testnet, you would need to comment some lines out, that are marked in the code as test only

[05/03/2025 20:21] theschnilch
I think I can't do that, unfortunately, because the transactions I make to test a bug would be public and one could then reverse engineer the bug.


[05/03/2025 20:22] 0xsigmoid
Yeah that's true I suppose. Someone would need to be looking at your address + know about this audit though, right


[05/03/2025 20:22] 0xradian
Fair, however it would just be on your address, that noone knows, you can just create a new one


[05/03/2025 20:22] 0xradian
just for this, its security by obscurity, but the chances are low


[05/03/2025 20:28] theschnilch
@kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 Is it allowed to test bugs on a public testnet according to the C4 rules?

Im not sure that we have any particular rules re: that.

In case i found low issue is it rewarded or only H/M


[05/11/2025 00:51] thebrittfactor
Issues downgraded to `low` are not awarded. Additionally, this audit didn't have a QA pool, so only HMs will be awarded.


[05/12/2025 00:56] tchkvsky
Hi, when does PJQA start? I assume it should be starting soon as most of the issues have been triaged by the judge. There's an issue of mine that was invalidated but I can't comment on it.

Also, this channel has been archived. Is that typically done when the contest ends or when payouts are finalized.


[05/12/2025 08:01] welith
only the SR role can comment during PJQA
